Gibson's theory of affordance, in its adherence to bottom-up direct perception, is
antithetical to the top-down inferential models often proposed by modern robotics
research purporting to tackle it. Such research assumes internal representation to
be sacrosanct, but given current developments, to what extent can this assumption
now be reexamined? The recently proposed sensorimotor contingency theory furthers
the theoretical argument that internal representation is unnecessary, and its
proof-of-concept application in robotics as well as the subsequent explosion in
deep learning methodology sheds new light on the possibility of equipping robots
with the capacity for directly perceiving their environments by exploiting correlated
changes in their sensory inputs triggered by executing specific motor programs. This
reexamination of direct perception is only one of several issues warranting scrutiny
in current robotic affordance research. The aim of this workshop is therefore twofold.

Firstly, we will provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in affordance research
and dissect open research challenges yielded thereof. 

Secondly, we will encourage our speakers to debate whether computational models of
affordance can potentially be advanced by adopting approaches that are more congruent
with Gibson's original conception of direct perception. 


### Previous edition

This workshop proposal is a sequel to the 1st edition of the International Workshop on Computational Models of Affordance in Robotics at RSS 2018. The rich and interdisciplinary discussions that took place there call for a second edition. Additionally, as the survey below shows [1], affordances are a topic of high interest in robotics, readily showing that such an interdisciplinary workshop is of high relevance to advance affordance research in robotics.

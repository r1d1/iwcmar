## Can Affordances be Detected, rather than Computed?

The idea of computing affordances is anathema to the ecological approach to perception and action. Affordances, according to Gibson (who coined the term), are not properties that need to be computed as comparisons of world and body. Instead, they are properties of the environment specified by information (in the Gibsonian sense), often a product of action, that needs to be registered by smart devices. Such registration is best understood as resonance. An analogous principle, direct learning, holds for how information guides the process of change. Robotics and AI are in a position to exploit and elaborate a resonance approach.
